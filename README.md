# MitoPlayer 2024

**Custom MP3 player and playlist assistant for DJs**, designed to organize large music libraries, assign rich metadata, and generate harmonically compatible playlists — faster and more intuitively than traditional tools.

## 🎧 Why I built it

As a DJ, I needed a tool that helps me manage my music with custom properties like tone, BPM, vocal presence, and more. MitoPlayer lets me filter, organize, and preview tracks in a clean interface — with full control over playlist generation.

Originally built in Java/Swing, the app was rewritten in 2024 using **C# (WinForms)** and **MySQL** for better performance and extensibility.
