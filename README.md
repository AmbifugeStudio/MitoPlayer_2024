In 2024, I worked on one of my main projects: a custom MP3 player app designed for DJs to help them quickly create harmonious playlists. The idea came from my own need as a DJ for a tool that could automate some of my mixing techniques and present a large music library in a clear, organized way.

The first version was built using Java with a Swing-based interface, and it allowed me to manage playlists, define custom properties (like tone, style, and vocal presence), and create rules to make sure the tracks worked well together.

In 2024, I rewrote the app using C#, WinForms, and added a MySQL database to expand its features. The app now includes:

- Playing MP3 files and managing playlists
- Importing BPM and key data from MixedInKey or VirtualDJ
- Handling custom metadata (like tone, BPM, and intro length)
- Filtering tracks by metadata
- Browsing by album covers
- Exporting and renaming tracks
- Live streaming and displaying data from VirtualDJ
- Drag-and-drop support for external software
- Rule and template management (coming soon)
- Semi-automatic and fully-automatic playlist generation (coming soon)

The future goal of the development is to enable users to define rules that establish the relationships between metadata, such as how different tones relate to each other and to what degree (e.g., the harmony between tones). Based on these rules, users will be able to create templates that generate playlists where the tracks match perfectly according to the specified metadata and rules.

This app not only supports DJs with their work but also provides a personalized solution for organizing and picking music. I use it every day not only to enjoy my music but also to carefully curate and organize my playlists, discovering new ways to blend tracks and create the perfect listening experience. Itâ€™s become an essential tool that helps me stay inspired and energized while fine-tuning my music collection.
